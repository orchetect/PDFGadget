[![CI Build Status](https://github.com/orchetect/PDFGadget/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orchetect/PDFGadget/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Platforms - macOS 11+ | iOS 14+ | visionOS 1+](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-macOS%2011+%20|%20iOS%2014+%20|%20visionOS%201+-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift) ![Swift 5.6-6.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.6‚Äì6.0-orange.svg?style=flat) [![Xcode 16+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-16+-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift) [![License: MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/orchetect/PDFGadget/blob/main/LICENSE)

Batch PDF utilities with simple API for Swift. Declarative API for:

- assigning or removing file attributes (metadata)
- file filtering, ordering, and merging
- page management: reordering, collation, copying, moving, and replacement
- page presentation: rotation, cropping, etc.
- page content: filtering, removal or burn-in of annotations

> [!NOTE]
> Currently this package is only a Swift library. A CLI tool and/or GUI frontend may be added in future.

## Basic Usage

```swift
import PDFGadget

let sources = [URL, URL, URL, ...] // URLs to one or more PDF files
let outputDir = URL.desktopDirectory
```

The steps of loading source PDFs, performing operations, and saving the resulting PDFs can be performed individually:

```swift
let pdfGadget = PDFGadget()

try pdfGadget.load(pdfs: sources)
try pdfGadget.perform(operations: [
    // one or more operations
])

// access the resulting PDF documents in memory
pdfGadget.pdfDocuments // [PDFDocument]

// or save them as PDF files to disk
try pdfGadget.savePDFs(outputDir: outputDir)
```

Or a fully automated batch operation can be run with a single call to `run()` by passing in a populated instance of `PDFGadget.Settings`.

```swift
let settings = try PDFGadget.Settings(
    sourcePDFs: sources,
    outputDir: outputDir,
    operations: [
        // one or more operations
    ],
    savePDFs: true
)

try PDFGadget().run(using: settings)
```

## Batch Operations

The following are single operations that may be used in a batch sequence of operations.

>  **Note**: More to be added in future, including: page cropping, more sophisticated annotation editing/filtering/removal.

### File Operations

- New empty file
- Clone file
- Filter files
- Merge files
- Set file filename(s)
- Set or remove file attributes (metadata such as title, author, etc.)
- Remove file protections (encryption and permissions)

### Page Operations

- Filter pages
- Copy pages
- Move pages
- Replace pages by copying or moving them
- Reverse page order (all or subset of pages)
- Rotate pages
- Crop pages
- Split file into multiple files

### Page Content Operations

- Filter annotations (by types, or remove all)
- Burn in annotations
- Extract plain text (to system pasteboard, to file on disk, or to variable in memory)
