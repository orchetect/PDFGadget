# PDFTool

Batch PDF utilities with simple API for Swift.

*(Currently only a Swift library. CLI and/or GUI frontend may be added in future.)*

## Basic Usage

```swift
let sources = [URL, URL, URL, ...] // URLs to one or more PDF files
let outputDir = URL.desktopFolder
```

The steps of loading source PDFs, performing operations, and saving the resulting PDFs can be performed individually:

```swift
let pdfTool = PDFTool()

try pdfTool.load(pdfs: sources)
try pdfTool.perform(operations: [
    // one or more operations
])

// access the resulting PDF documents in memory
pdfTool.pdfDocuments // [PDFDocument]

// or save them as PDF files to disk
try pdfTool.savePDFs(outputDir: outputDir)
```
Or a fully automated batch operation can be run with a single call to `run()` by passing in a populated instance of `PDFTool.Settings`.

```swift
let settings = PDFTool.Settings(
    sourcePDFs: sources,
    outputDir: outputDir,
    operations: [
        // one or more operations
    ],
    savePDFs: true
)

try PDFTool().run(using: settings)
```

## Batch Operations

The following are single operations that may be used in a batch sequence of operations. More to be added in future.

### File Operations

- New empty file
- Clone file
- Filter files
- Merge files
- Set file's filename

### Page Operations

- Copy pages

- Replace pages by copying or moving them
